            This is my bread and butter. Anything from creating an MVP,
            building a mobile experience, or API creation/integration, this is where I feel 
            most at home.

            Great execution is at the heart of any successful project. Using modern, agile techniques 
            and quick feedback loops I can build and execute a plan of attack successfully.
