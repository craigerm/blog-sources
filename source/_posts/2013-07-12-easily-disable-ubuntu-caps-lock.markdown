I hate the caps lock button. 

It does have its uses, and no, not only for
YELLING IN EMAILS, but also for accessibility.

Today I just had enough with pressing it by accident in Vim, so I decided to disable
it at the OS level. It turns out it's super easy in Ubuntu 13.04:

** All Settings > Keyboard Layout > Options > And choose caps lock is disabled **

Alternatively you could map the caps lock to the escape key for Vim only. I
prefer getting rid of it completely though. Happy coding!
